        The White Tiger Monastery is a proposed quasi-secular, leftist monastery. (I named it White Tiger because of the Kung Fu allusions but also because of the movie White Tiger.) Chat GPT once described this belief system as 'a religion for post-capitalist suvivors' and Chat GPT slander-aside, I think that's dead on.

        <b><span id='the-divinity-of-infrastructure'>The Divinity of Infrastructure</span></b> - To participate in the consumption or utilization of something that was created by someone who is not part of the monastery is considered sin. If you consume or utilize something that was created by someone who is part of the monastery but they created it with resources from outside of the monastery, this is still partial sin. In order to evaluate your own sin, individuals should engage in  <b>The Discipline</b> in which they will go out of their way to keep track of the things they are in contact with that is sinful and avoid it if they can. By doing this, you help to mitigate the inherent sin of capitalism.
    </div><div>
        <b>The Divinity of Labor</b> - A person's work is holy and sacred. You give it to others out of love and kindness or obligation but to do so for money is lowly and sinful. To barter your labor is less sinful but still sinful. 
	</div><div>
        <b>The Divinity of Land</b> - A Capitalist sees land as nothing more than a number on a sheet of paper, but land should never be sold. Land is the space we inhabit and the resources we have. The Divinity of Infrastructure and the sin related to that is inherent to the world we live in but selling land is never inevitable. It should be a last resort on par with sacrificing yourself.
    </div><div>
        <b>The Centrality of Humanity:</b> All these things being considered, these are ideologies aspiring to a utopia - that likely can never be achieved. But just because the chips are stacked against us doesn't mean we shouldn't try. And just because these are lofty ideals doesn't mean that you should live in shame for not achieving them. Maybe a little bit of shame. But you are human. You are imperfect. You are irrational. You are not a thing to achieve. You exist purely for the sake of existing. And sometimes, that's the best you can do.
    </div><div>
        That being said, there are minimum standards within the community (which will be established by each community naturally as part of an organic process) and the whole point of being part of a community is living up to its expectations. Conversely, a community has a responsibility to guide its members on that path as well and to help them along.
    </div><div>
        <b>vow of poverty: </b> One of the most important things about being part of the monastery is separating from consumer instincts and capitalist culture. Enacting a vow of poverty is a part of that. Adherents are only allowed to keep an income equal to poverty level. All other income needs to be donated to the monastery for community purposes. 
    </div><div>

        <b>joining:</b>
    </div><div>
         People join the monastery by being sponsored by a member and can only be admitted or excommunicated by unanimous vote. When you join, there is a probationary period to see if you are compatible with the monastery and you are at that point only an initiate. Each member may sponsor one person and is responsible for that initiate when they join. Members and initiates are not allowed to touch unless it is an emergency, either medical or psychiatric. (To be clear, this is between members and initiates not members and members or initiates and initiates. This is a rule to prevent predatory relationships between people in authority.)

        <b>origins:</b>
    </div><div>
        I was inspired by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in creating this ideology. He talked about how in America, all dairy products have kosher symbols on them, despite Jewish people representing a relatively small percentage, because their dearly held beliefs are so dear to them that businesses have no choice but to cave when the alternative is alienating that segment. He talked some more about the utility of rigidly held beliefs and intolerance towards other belief systems. That's when I realized the achilles heel of liberals in America. Conservatives, the great majority of them, believe that people on the left are literally evil or at the very least, influenced by evil. Liberals, in contrast, believe that conservatives are just ignorant pawns. Maybe they're relgious or racist bigots, but they don't know any better. And only now as the pendulum is swinging them towards the losing end are they starting to adopt less charitable views.
    </div><div>
        That being said, a leftist, post-scarcity future can only be created <b> if no other contradictory belief system is tolerated.</b> (Obviously, they can exist elsewhere outside of the monastery. But there's no room for them in our belief system.) And that's why I want to start this monastery. To find like-minded people and create the future I've always wanted. And maybe that won't happen. Maybe I'll never find anyone to join me. But I would rather live a life forever alone how I want than compromise.

    <h3 id='discipline' class="center">The Discipline</h3>
    <div>
        The Discipline is when you live within the context of <a href="#the-divinity-of-infrastructure">The Divinity of Infrastructure</a>. I write down everything that I interact with that I did not personally create. (I have taken to calling this The Paper.) As of right now, I make exceptions for the fact that:
    </div>
    <ul>

        <li>I live in a house I didn't make (this includes utilities)</li>
        <li>use furniture I didn't make</li>
        <li>any infrastructure related to preparing food</li>
        <li>anything medical</li>
        <li>anything used in the production of something for The Discipline (for now at least)</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        The Paper contains a five square grid where I keep track of the following: 
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>interactions with infrastructure (except for the exceptions above)</li>
        <li>food</li>
        <li>computer programs and mobile apps</li>  
        <li>media that I consume that is <a href="writings/halal-media.html">haram</a>
        <li>websites/services that are not purely informational - (I've defined this as any service that requires logging in as part of that interaction)</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        In terms of language, I have borrowed terms from Islam to describe exceptions to The Discipline for media. <a href='writings/halal-media.html'> halal/haram media</a>. This created a need for a word of something that has been created for The Discipline: exalted. Something that is exalted has been created to fulfill The Discipline.
    </div><div>
        I noticed that on days that I'm not following The Discipline, I don't know how long it's been outside of grabbing that last Paper to see. I would think it's been three days and it's been eight. So in the spirit of keeping track better, I created a calendar so I can visually tell how long it's been since the last time I followed The Discipline.
    </div><div></div>
        There are some other arbitrary rules that I follow. I don't know important they are for -other- people to follow, but these are mine:
    </div><div>
        No consumption of fiction (text or video) or video games before dusk. This was because I was spending a huge amount of time just watching tv shows, movies, reading novels and playing vdeo games all day.
    </div><div>
        I can only listen to music before solar noon from the radio or halal music that I've previously saved. Now it's not a problem to listen to music in of itself but my problem was that I was overly focused on the music, like obsessively changing it to the next song trying to find one that was compelling enough to save.
    </div><div>
        Try not to immediately turn my computer on when I wake up. I'm overly dependent on the computer as a form of entertainment. This is more of an experiment than a hard-set rule, becaues creating a modern day computer is outside of my any realistic capabilities.
