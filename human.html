      I've been generating a lot of stuff for the monastery with Chat GPT. Most of it's just helping me flesh out ideas. Like, it was Chat GPT that characterized this as a religion for post-capitalism survivors. That was a really insightful thing and I appreciate it.

      But The Centrality of Humanity and just the backlash in general against AI means I owe an obligation to have a few things that are entirely written by me.

      One document that, just by the nature of it, will always be human written is <a href="/log.html">my White Tiger journal</a> where I talk about some of the challenges and successes I experience during this process.
