    The Sacred Weight of Staying
      Not Nature, But History
    The monastery I imagine does not follow the lineage of hippie communes or the ‘back to nature’ movement. 

    When I talk about the divinity of land, it is not the divinity of nature. Land is not sacred because it is nature. Land is sacred because it is history. Not of history. But it is history itself. 

    If the monastery becomes a thing and continues into the future, it continues from a point in history that is tied to a specific point in space, which is land. 

    My mother was a Navy brat, moving constantly through her childhood and while I didn't live in nearly as many places as she did, I lived in more places than I would have liked. All of the places from my childhood don't exist. The stores and restaurants I frequented no longer exist. The parks I played in don't have the same playgrounds. The only place that has remained relatively the same and is still accessible to me is my grandmother's house. And one of the greatest pains that I will ever experience is when she dies and her children sell the house and some stranger will be living there. Half a century of history and legacy erased and forgotten as soon as I die.

    We lived in a house when I was a young child, and I have a ton of memories from there. The tree in the backyard, where I snuck into a neighbor's yard when I accidentally dropped my action figure and had a bewildering conversation with a pair of twins. My late uncle had a collection of bikes that he would just keep adding to and he actually lived in the backyard for quite a period of time. A small playset where I'd be terrified of the neighbor's dog because it faced a small hole where they'd stick their head through and bark at me. The garage that my father fashioned into a proper bedroom that was my playroom when I was very small. 
    
    We moved eventually but I have all these memories. And that's all they are now. The people that moved in after we left changed everything. Tore the tree down. Tore the playset down. And that place literally exists only in my mind now. 

    The spaces that we inhabit have a little bit of sacredness and sometimes, a lot. But the sacredness of these spaces does not come from nature. It comes from the people we share it with, the experiences we have with them and what's remembered when we're long gone.
