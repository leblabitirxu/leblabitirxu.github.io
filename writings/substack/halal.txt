Entertainment Media and The Discipline

Under the Divinity of Infrastructure, entertainment media isn’t automatically allowed. Media made within the monastery, for the purpose of The Discipline, is fine. But entertainment made outside the community is generally not acceptable.

That said, the White Tiger Monastery doesn’t aim for total isolation. Some outside entertainment is allowed, but with clear limits. Right now, only entertainment made ten cycles ago or earlier is considered “halal” (acceptable). This rule helps avoid the habit of constantly checking what new media is allowed each day. Instead, with each new cycle, more media becomes accessible. This limit might be pushed back even further in the future to reduce outside influence.

Some works are always allowed, no matter when they were made, because they are important to the monastery’s ideas—like White Tiger (2021) and Anathem (2008).
Fiction vs. Nonfiction

This rule is about entertainment, not information. Nonfiction content, like documentaries or news, is allowed even if it’s recent—as long as it’s informative and not made just for entertainment.

However, things like editorials, commentaries, or opinion pieces that came out after the ten-cycle limit are considered haram (not allowed), because they often mix facts with emotional or persuasive content.
Websites and the Digital World

Websites work differently than regular media. Even looking at the news online can lead to endless scrolling, which is a kind of consumption on its own. So, the internet must be used only for clear, informational purposes—like looking up facts or instructions.

If you’re using a social media site to look up something specific (like a person’s account) and not browsing around, that doesn’t need to be tracked under The Discipline. But general use—like scrolling, liking, or watching—does.

Some situations are more of a gray area. For example, reading a Reddit thread comparing EPUB and PDF formats has opinions in it, but it’s still informative and can help make a decision. That kind of use is okay.
Special Cases and Unclear Situations

There are some tricky situations that don’t have perfect answers yet. For example:

    Should we count when a movie first premiered, or when it became widely available? Right now, the rule is to go by the earliest release.

    If a TV broadcast aired after the cutoff but featured an old show, that’s okay.

    If new content is released from someone who made it during the halal time (like Nirvana), that’s okay too, even if it came out later.

What About Learning for Its Own Sake?

One question that’s still being thought through is: What if the information you’re reading doesn’t directly help with The Discipline?

Right now, we don’t draw a hard line here. But there’s a concern that learning just for the sake of collecting facts can become a kind of mental clutter. In the future, we might define clearer rules about what kind of knowledge is useful and what kind just adds noise.
