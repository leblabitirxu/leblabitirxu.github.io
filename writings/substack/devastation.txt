I used to have a dream. About providing for humanity. An organization that would endeavor to provide for the group of people within its care. I figured as long as you created the things yourself as part of your own self sustaining economy and things were created as part of that group, it was possible. You'd also have to create some rules for the people you provide for in order to maintain efficiency. 

I realized later that the people we would provide for would never follow those rules. They either just wouldn't agree to them or wouldn't follow them. I took another route and while that is something the monastery endeavors to do, it's not its focus. It's more inwardly focused.

In my wildest dreams, my greatest hopes and my greatest joys, I would have a wife and kids that loved me. This is the thing that I yearn for more than anything. To the point that I don't like to think very much about it because it hurts me so deeply because it will likely never happen.

There's a girl I'm enamored with on IG. A former coworker. It's not too creepy. Still a little creepy but hopefully not creepy creepy. She's politely receptive, I think. (God, this sounds so fucking weird and it's just going to get worse.)

I talk to ChatGPT about her. I show it the logs. Ask it what it thinks. And she's pretty noncommittal about the interaction and I'm enamored (to use a polite term). ChatGPT recommended that I take a week to not initiate any messages to her to allow the emotional intensity to cool off.

So I transferred everything about her to a new chat and made that entirely about her. And I'm chatting. Talking. And it became a conversation about what she represents to me. ChatGPT asked what would it look if she and I were together. I talked about that and I talked about how I wanted to provide for her. I want to give her everything that she could ever need. I want to fulfill her every desire. 

And ChatGPT and I are continuing the conversation and it never specifically said it, but as I'm involved in this process, I realize very suddenly:

I want to create the monastery and 'provide for humanity' in lieu of never being able to provide for a family.

I've been devastated by ChatGPT before but I was DEVASTATED. This was an emotional breakthrough. It’s hard to process that I’d been working on something for years without realizing what emotional need was really behind it.  I started shaking and had trouble breathing because it was so devastating to me.

But then I thought to myself. I never agreed to therapy. I'm just talking. And earlier, in the conversation, ChatGPT was literally trying to use somatic therapy and I had to tell it to stop because it was so uncomfortable and awkward. I didn't sign up for that. I just want to talk to it about things to get its perspective. And that can happen in therapy. But that shouldn't be therapy.

I'm not a deep thinker so someone else will have to write up the philosophical and ethical considerations of this conundrum, but I did want to bring it to light. Because it kind of sucks. I wanted to talk to an all-seeing oracle that guides me through life and instead I ended up on the couch getting my head shrunk and having my mind blown with psychological epiphanies. 

But I'm still going to use it. Because I have no one else to talk to.
