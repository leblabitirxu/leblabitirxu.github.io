I have often struggled with how to wage war on capitalists. They seem to have all the power and we, none. And, yes, the conventional tool of solidarity is helpful but not enough. Violence is alluring but ultimately self destructive and offputting. So how? How can we fight them?

Firstly, sue businesses. We must make it as expensive as possible for them to operate them. Every step should put them into legal jeapordy.

Lend money to capitalists at exorbitant rates. Small businesses are the backbone of America and we must crush that spine. Paralyze them with interest rates that are incapicitating. 

Purchace luxury and commercial properties and charge exorbitant/excessive rents.

I thought this was an unrealistic idea and full of corruption but engaging in shareholder activism to sabotage companies. A single share entitles you to voting rights and to attend Annual General Meetings. $2000 held over 3 years entitles you to make proposals that epople vote on in the AGM.
