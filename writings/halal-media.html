    <h2>From the Consecrated Machine: On Halal and Haram Media</h2>
    <h4>Introduction / Rationale</h4>
    <div>
        If you are legalistically following the prohibitions set forth by The Consecrated Machine, by extension, you would have to stop consuming unexalted media. (Exalted is the term to describe something that has been created by either you or someone within the organization.) 
</div><h5>The Consecrated Machine</h5>
<div>
    
    The Consecrated Machine represents the ideal of an ethical infrastructure—crafted, understood, and maintained independently of capitalist systems. To approach it is to sanctify one's material dependencies.

</div><div>
        That's a huge imposition and The Monastery of The White Tiger isn't about social isolation. But at the same time, it's important to divorce ourselves from the consumer compulsion. Consumption of media is different from physical infrastructure because the consumer compulsion doesn't manifest as merely its consumption. When I need to use a piece of paper, my consumption ends when it has been used. (for the most part) For media, a large part of the consumer culture surrounding it is the discussion of that new thing, its effect on society and the consumer's FOMO on not being able to engage in that discussion. Novelty is the engine of consumer media. By removing access to the new, we interrupt the cycle of compulsive engagement and reclaim our attention.
</div><h4>Definition of "Exalted" Media</h4>
<div>
    As I was formulating The Discipline, which is how to properly guide ourselves towards The Consecrated Machine. (The Discipline is the ongoing spiritual and ethical practice of minimizing reliance on commodified media. It includes conscious abstention, mindful logging of exceptions, and reflective inquiry into one’s habits of consumption. It is the method by which we orient ourselves toward The Consecrated Machine.) The Consecrated Machine basically says that it is sinful to be dependent on the market economy to live and there is a clear moral imperative to create the things that you need in order to live. It became important to create a shorthand for this. Exalted refers to any work created by oneself or by a member of the Monastery—or an affiliated community. Exalted media would be music, videos, writing or video games created in that fashion. The problem with this is that while possible it's hard to be truly engaged with media you created yourself. As someone who consumes media voraciously, I don't think it would be possible for me to confine myself just to exalted media for a relatively small group.
</div>
        <h4>Temporal Discipline & Timekeeping</h4>
<div>
    For the sake of using an exalted method of measuring time, I created a system of timekeeping. Well, namely two systems: one which is earth-based metric time and the other is universal metric time, but for the purposes of this writing, we'll mainly concern ourselves with universal metric time. 
    
    <!--The utility of the metric system is that things are divisible by a factor of ten. You don't have to remember how many inches in a foot in a yard or teaspoons in cup in a quart. It's just remembering what factor of ten it is and work accordingly. It's more natural but weirdly, we didn't apply that to time. 60 seconds per 60 minutes per 24 hours per 365 days per year.  
</div><div>
    The hard part for me was figuring out how to delineate it, but basically for universal metric time, every day is 100k seconds. -->
     A conventional solar day of 86,400 seconds is reconceived as a cycle of 100,000 metric seconds. Each metric second is 1.16 sidereal seconds — a new standard rooted in cosmological regularity rather than industrial utility. That's how you keep track of time throughout the day. And for universal metric time, days are organized into 1000 day cycles. <!--I created an algorithm to calculate it out based on linux time and adding a few more years to the year system based on the estimated dawn of history. (10k added to the current years) --> The current year of 2025 is currently equal to cycle 4391. June 1 2025 is equal to the 910th day of that cycle or 4391-910. <!--(Earth-based metric time is more centered around being on Earth with the 100k seconds starting at 0 at solar noon every day, having more or less than 100k depending on the length of day and organized into 365 day years.)-->
</div>
<h4>Halal vs Haram</h4>
<div>
    Everything within ten cycles (~30 years) is considered haram. Everything past ten cycles ago is considered halal. Ten cycles (~30 years) approximates a generational shift. This boundary severs us from the compulsions of the present moment and allows spiritual detachment.  Future members may still revise this number according to their sensibilities though. I think an important thing to emphasize is that this is not a blanket ban on haram consumption. You'd merely have to log it appropriately as part of The Discipline. 
</div><div>
    This prohibition applies to entertainment media. Non-fiction that is informational like news reports are halal but non-fiction that is entertainment like editorials and commentaries are haram. A clarification: exalted media and halal/haram media are separate categories. Halal and haram are terms reserved for defining unexalted media.
</div>
<h4>Temporal Boundaries</h4>
<div>
    An important clarification is that it's not 10 cycles from -now-. I realized that if you do that, it creates an incentive for members to constantly be researching, "What new media is available?". So it's ten cycles from the beginning of the cycle, so it'll Jul 15, 1995 until 90 days from now when it'll be a new cycle and a new day which will be chosen ten cycles from then. (Fri Apr 24 1998)
</div>

<h4>
Edge Cases
</h4><div>
    It's important to define consumption as something you willfully choose to consume. An exception is made for broadcast media in which you don't have control over what particular thing will come next or if someone plays a piece of media where you are. The main distinction in this is your willful choice of the consumption. So putting on a radio station that plays haram media is completely acceptable but actively looking at the listings on the television and choosing a particular station because they are playing a particular haram media is a willful choice and requires The Discipline. 
</div><div>
    Additionally, some media is considered exempted because of how culturally relevant they are to The Monastery of The White Tiger. New exceptions may be proposed by community consensus.
</div><ul><li>
    White Tiger (2012) - this particular film really exemplified what it means to toil under a capitalist regime
</li><li>
    Anathem (2008) - for its role in helping me envision a secular monastery
</li></ul><div>
    There are edge cases as well. Media that is released at a haram date that was created in a halal time is halal. An example would be a musician dies in 1994. A new release was just dropped a month ago. If a limited release date is before the halal/haram date but the general release date is after, it is still considered halal. Another edge case is a TV show or movie that was released in a halal time but it was recorded in a haram time. That's also halal as well.
</div><div>
    Now while nonfiction commentary in of itself is considered haram, if that commentary is for informative purposes, it's halal. For example, you're reading a bunch of opinions that people are giving for the purposes of making an informed decision (and not for entertainment purposes).
</div><h4>
    Websites & Non-Traditional Media
</h4><div>
    Websites are a tricky thing because browsing a website for informational purposes is completely halal but browsing social media is haram. In this case, the consumption becomes the compulsive scrolling that social media algorithms encourage. But if you were simply to look up someone's social media profile page to understand more about them, that's halal. 
</div><h4>
   Open Questions / Revisions

</h4><div>
    This does bring up the question of: what if media is informational but not in service to The Discipline? That's probably too dogmatic to be considered for right now. There remains a lingering question: is the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake—absent application to The Discipline—a form of intellectual indulgence?
</div><div>
    The Monastery is a living experiment. The Discipline may evolve. But its root remains the same: to wrest our spiritual life back from the market.
</div>
<!--
         As part of <b>The Divinity of Infrastructure,</b> entertainment media is not exempt from this precept. Exalted entertainment media (media created as part of The Discipline) is completely fine, but entertainment media not created by the monastery itself is not. (at least theoretically) The Monastery of the White Tiger is not about complete isolation though, so we do include some entertainment media. Right now, only entertainment media produced from  before <span id='halal-time'></span> is considered halal. In univeral metric time, (ignoring the current number of days in this cycle) that's ten cycles ago. Originally, it was going to be ten cycles from the present day but then I realized that I don't want to be constantly checking every day, "What new media do I have access to today?" so it's easier to do it this way. That way, there's another positive to every new cycle. (Though, this time period may be extended even further.) There's also other media that's been grandfathered in due to its nature: <em>White Tiger (2021)</em> and <em>Anathem (2008)</em>.
    </div><div>
        Notice that previous statements were in regards to <b>entertainment media</b>. Anything non-fictional that is not for entertainment purposes is grandfathered in. News reports from new organizations are considered halal. Editorials and commentaries from after the previously mentioned time period are considered haram.
    </div><div>
        Websites are not considered media in the same sense as what I've previously described. Websites (and the electronic feed, in general) changes the form of consumption drastically to where even if you're just perusing the news, it becomes a form of consumption in of itself. The halal usage of websites should be informational purposes only. Anything else requires The Discipline. So while you would normally write down a social media site as a service you are using, if you are using that social media site to look up someone's social media account and not going through the site or their page, this does not require The Discipline.
    </div><div>
        Though, there is a fuzzy margin there in the context of non-fiction. Yesterday, I researched EPUB vs PDF and found a reddit post where people were discussing the merits of each format. Now that is opinion, similar to an editorial, but it is informational in the sense that it is giving me context to weigh different options.
    </div><div>
        Another interesting question in regards to the release dates of media: should you include the first time it was ever released or when it would have been available to you? As of right now, The Usual Suspects is fine if I judge it by when it was released at Sundance but if I go by the general release, that's after. For now, we'll do the first time, but it does create questions.
    </div><div>
        There are also other edge cases. For example, I have recorded television broadcasts that took place after the point of halal/haram, but the shows themselves were originally broadcast in a time of being halal. Additionally, media is released in haram time periods but was obviously made in a halal time period. (Nirvana - the lead singer died when it was halal but new media is still being released) Both of these cases are fine.
    </div><div>
        This does bring up the question of: what if media is informational but not in service to The Discipline? That's probably too dogmatic to be considered for right now. Though, there is something kind of masturbatory about learning facts for the sake of facts and this maybe reconsidered at a future date.
