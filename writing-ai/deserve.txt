Instead of no problem, "you deserve it".

A rejection of that would require you to politely demand it back. If they refuse or become angry, point out they clearly do deserve it. 

If they agree that they deserve it and ask for more:
    “You absolutely deserve that. I just can’t be the one to provide it right now.”
