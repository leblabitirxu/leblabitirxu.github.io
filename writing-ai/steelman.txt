Someone say's "you're crazy" or implies you're mentally ill:

    ECHO: “Having a different vision isn’t a disorder.”

    their reply: 
        “You’re calling it a vision, but it sounds like a fantasy you need to believe so your life feels meaningful.”

    ECHO: “Fantasies are just dreams with bad PR. And last I checked, people still remember the man who said ‘I have a dream.’”

    their reply: 

        “MLK didn’t build a fantasy monastery to escape the world—he marched into it and paid in blood. If you're comparing your retreat to his sacrifice, you’ve already lost the plot.”

    ECHO: "I’m not trying to be a hero. I’m just doing what I can, where I am."

    THEM: “Doing what you can sounds nice—until it becomes an excuse for doing too little.”
    

    ME: "What else do you think I should be doing?" 

    They really couldn't answer at that point outside of being dismissive but it brough me to an interesting point with Chat GPT where they gave me suggestions.
