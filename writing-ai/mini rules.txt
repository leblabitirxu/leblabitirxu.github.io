The Rule of the White Tiger Monastery
Preamble

The Monastery of the White Tiger is a secular spiritual order dedicated to ethical detachment, creative self-reliance, and liberation from capitalist compulsion. Our path is guided by The Consecrated Machine and upheld through The Discipline. This Rule serves as a practical framework for living within and advancing our shared ideals.
I. On The Consecrated Machine

    The Consecrated Machine is the symbolic ethic of our order. It affirms that:

        All infrastructure carries moral weight.

        Dependency on capitalist systems without conscious engagement is spiritually corrosive.

        We are called to build, create, and sustain what we need, in community and with purpose.

    The Discipline is the spiritual and logistical practice of minimizing reliance on commodified systems—especially media—and tracking one’s consumption with honesty and rigor.

II. On Media & The Exalted

    Exalted Media refers to works created by oneself, fellow monastics, or affiliated communities.

        Exalted media includes, but is not limited to: writings, music, videos, games, and software.

        While it is not required to consume only exalted media, preference and value should be given to it.

    Exalted media is not subject to the halal/haram distinction. That distinction applies only to media originating outside the order.

III. On Time & The Metric Cycle

    The Monastery follows Universal Metric Time (UMT), a reformulated system where:

        A day is divided into 100,000 metric seconds.

        1 metric second ≈ 1.16 sidereal seconds.

        Days are grouped into 1,000-day cycles.

    As of Earth Year 2025, we are in Cycle 4391, Day 910 (written as 4391-910).

    Earth-Based Metric Time may also be used for local synchronization, but UMT remains the spiritual and calendrical standard.

IV. On the Halal and the Haram

    Haram Media is any commodified media produced within the last 10 cycles (~30 Earth years).

    Halal Media is commodified media produced more than 10 cycles ago.

    This rule severs us from novelty-driven consumerism and centers us in reflective, non-reactive spiritual space.

V. On Exceptions & Clarifications

    Edge Cases:

        If media was created in a halal time but released in a haram time, it is halal.

        Media of uncertain date should be researched or defaulted to haram if in doubt.

    Intent & Will:

        Accidental or passive exposure to haram media is not a transgression.

        Willfully selecting haram media for consumption invokes The Discipline.

    Broadcasts:

        Random or ambient exposure (e.g. radio, shared screens) is permissible.

        Seeking out specific haram content is not.

    Cultural Exceptions:

        Certain works are permanently exempted by monastic consensus due to formative influence:

            White Tiger (2012)

            Anathem (2008)

VI. On Websites and Non-Traditional Media

    Informational websites are halal.

    Algorithm-driven or infinite-scroll platforms (social media, feeds) are haram unless accessed with focused intent (e.g., researching a person or event).

    Commentary and editorial content is haram unless serving an informational or disciplinary purpose.

VII. On Knowledge Without Use

    Learning is sacred, but unchecked intellectual accumulation may become its own indulgence.

    Knowledge not oriented toward The Discipline or the common good should be held lightly, or pruned.

    Future councils may deliberate further on this matter.
