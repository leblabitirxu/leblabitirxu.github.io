OPENING

We gather not to deny death, but to bear witness to it.
We do not turn away. We remain present.
Let us name who has passed, and hold them in shared memory.

(Name of the departed)
Born into a broken world.
Lived with intention.
Loved imperfectly.
Worked, endured, gave, and rested.
Now—joined to what outlives us all.
In what they changed. In what they gave. In what remains.

Earth and Ash Ritual

(Each mourner may step forward, speak a brief remembrance if desired, and cast a handful of soil or ash onto the ground or into a vessel.)

Chanted softly, as each person steps forward (repeat):

    “From ground we rise, to ground we return.”
    “From struggle we live, in struggle we rest.”


A Final Ethic
    We are not made to last.
    But while we live, we act.
    To ease suffering.
    To stand with the living.
    To make room for what is sacred.
    And when we fall, may our lives be seed—
    for those who continue the work.


Closing
    We do not bury them and forget.
    We carry them—
    In memory. In what they changed. In what remains.

    Let grief move through us.
    Let it anchor what endures.
    Let us stand with one another.

    Go now, into rest.
    We remain, to labor and to love.
    Until we, too, are returned.
