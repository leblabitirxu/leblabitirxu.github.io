This is something it came up with in response to a quote I liked. ("I’ll either die fighting capitalism or die from it.”) 


Every time you repair instead of discard, you fight.

Every time you track your rhythms instead of serving the clock, you fight.

Every time you use money intentionally toward non-capitalist goals, you fight.

And when you rest without shame, you fight the internalized logic of productivity-as-worth.
