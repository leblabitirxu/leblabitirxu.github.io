        Top DIY-Accessible Technologies (Revised)

    Soap

        Simple cold process or hot process methods using oil and lye.

        Cheap, scalable, and traditionally cottage-industry based.

    Towel / Hand Towel

        Easy to make with basic weaving or sewing.

        Can repurpose cloth from worn-out fabric sources.

    Pen

        Hand-carved dip pens from wood, bamboo, or feathers are easy to make.

        Ink can also be homemade with carbon or plant dyes.

    Shoes (basic sandals)

        Especially viable if modeled after minimalist styles (e.g., huaraches).

        Leather or tire soles, with simple cord or strap systems.

    Lunch Bag

        Sewable with canvas, waxed cotton, or even reused food packaging.

        A great early project for self-sufficiency.

    Book Holder

        Extremely simple to build with wood scraps, cardboard, or even wire.

        Practical workshop or study item.

    Hair Gel / Hair Spray / Shampoo

        Can be made using flaxseed, aloe vera, sugar water, or herbal rinses.

        Fully customizable with local or grown ingredients.

    Belt

        Simple cloth, rope, or leather belts are beginner-friendly.

        Minimal tools required, especially if you avoid buckles.

    Scanner

        Not DIY-friendly as a whole device, but:

            You can simulate scanning with a phone camera + stable light setup.

            DIY camera rigs or document holders are viable.

    Nail File

        Natural substitutes like sandstone or rough ceramics exist.

        You could make DIY filing tools with rough surfaces glued to wood.


    ðŸ”’ Top 10 Least Accessible Tech Items (Hardest to DIY)
Rank	Item	Why It's Inaccessible
1	Computer	Requires advanced materials, clean rooms, microchip fabrication. Essentially impossible to make independently.
2	Cell Phone	Even harder than a computer due to miniaturization, software, GPS, etc. Fully corporate.
3	PS4	Proprietary tech, DRM-locked software, complex microprocessors. Impossible to replicate or modify meaningfully.
4	Washer / Dryer	Can be built in extremely simplified versions, but modern machines are complex, motorized, and tightly regulated.
5	Vacuum	Motor, suction design, filters â€” possible but difficult to reproduce effectively without access to supply chains.
6	Scanner	Optics, lighting balance, software, and precision hardware = major technical barrier.
7	Bluetooth Speaker	Combination of custom electronics, sound engineering, and software control.
8	Mic (Microphone)	High-quality mics involve precision diaphragm manufacturing and circuitry â€” hard to reproduce.
9	Camera	Optics and sensors are extremely precise. While pinhole cameras exist, modern cameras are industrial.
10	Lights (Electric)	DIY candles or solar lanterns exist, but electric lighting requires wiring, power, and sometimes rare materials.
