  <section>
    <p>The White Tiger Monastery is a proposed quasi-secular, leftist spiritual community. Its name draws from martial arts mythology and the film <em>White Tiger</em>, symbolizing both discipline and transformation. It is intended for those disillusioned with consumer culture, seeking a life grounded in intentionality, communal ethics, and spiritual resistance.</p>

    <blockquote>"A religion for post-capitalist survivors."</blockquote>

    <p>This is not an exercise in utopian escapism—it is a lived response to the fragmentation, commodification, and alienation of modern life.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Core Principles</h2>

    <p>The White Tiger Monastery is a decidedly American response to an American disease: a society that measures human worth by economic output. The monastery rejects this premise. You matter not because of what you produce, but because you exist.</p>

    <p>Redemption is not necessary. You are not broken. Capitalism manufactures the wound and then sells you the cure. We reject that lie.</p>

    <p>However, belief alone is not enough. Half-measures will not suffice. This society may seem extreme, but that’s only because it refuses the distortions of the world around it. Its values are not radical—they are proportionate to the depth of modern injustice.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>1. The Consecrated Machine</h2>
    <p>All infrastructure carries ethical weight. Infrastructure—roads, utilities, software, packaging—reflects the values of its creators. Relying on capitalist infrastructure is spiritually corrosive unless engaged with mindfully.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. The Discipline</h2>
    <p>The Discipline is a practice of ethical reflection. Members use a log, <code>The Paper</code>, to track interactions with external infrastructure, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Non-community infrastructure</li>
      <li>Food</li>
      <li>Software or apps</li>
      <li>Non-aligned media ("haram media")</li>
      <li>Online services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is not confession. It is meditation. Some categories—utilities, medical supplies, housing—are exempt. The goal is awareness, not purity.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Sacred Labor</h2>
    <p>Labor is sacred. Work given freely, in care or creation, holds spiritual value. Wage labor is spiritually compromising. Where possible, members give labor freely as an act of love—not transaction.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. The Ground We Share</h2>
    <p>Land is not property. It is shared ground. In the monastery, land is held in trust and may never be sold. Doing so is seen as betrayal.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. The Centrality of Humanity</h2>
    <p>Perfection is not expected. Members will falter. But they are not machines to be optimized. You are human. Survival and sincerity are enough.</p>
    <p>Each community sets standards and responsibilities. In return, it provides structure, guidance, and care.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Community Practices</h2>

    <h3>The Vow of Poverty</h3>
    <p>Members cap their income at the national poverty line. Excess is donated back to the community. This is a rejection of the myth that wealth equals worth.</p>

    <h3>Membership and Admission</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Admission is by sponsorship (1 member → 1 initiate)</li>
      <li>Initiates undergo probation</li>
      <li>Unanimous vote required for admission or expulsion</li>
      <li>No physical contact with initiates (except in emergencies)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These rules exist to protect trust—not to enforce hierarchy.</p>

    <h3>Schisms</h3>
    <p>When consensus fails, communities may split. Resources are provided to help the new faction begin. This prevents resentment and fosters long-term cooperation between differing visions.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Origins and Influences</h2>
    <p>The monastery is inspired by thinkers like Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who showed how small, devout minorities can reshape whole systems. One group that refuses to compromise can redefine what is acceptable for all.</p>

    <p>Unlike liberal tolerance, which often assumes the best of others, this community does not make space for beliefs that erode its values. It does not aim to convert. It aims to survive.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The White Tiger Monastery is not a finished project. It is a living experiment in ethical living, spiritual discipline, and radical hope.</p>

    <p>Even if it never expands beyond a single person, it will have been worth doing. Better to live in alignment with one’s beliefs than compromise for comfort.</p>
